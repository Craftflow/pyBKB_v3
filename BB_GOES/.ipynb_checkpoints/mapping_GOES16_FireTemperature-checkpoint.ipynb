    "For this demo, you will need GOES-16 ABI level 2 data. You can get GOES-16 files from NOAA's GOES archive on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/goes/). I created a [web interface](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/cgi-bin/goes16_download.cgi?domain=C&product=ABI-L2-MCMIP&hour=0) to easily download files from the Amazon archive. For scripted or bulk downloads, you should use `rclone` or `AWS CLI`. You may also download files from the [Environmental Data Commons](http://edc.occ-data.org/goes16/getdata/) and [NOAA CLASS](https://www.avl.class.noaa.gov/saa/products/search?sub_id=0&datatype_family=GRABIPRD&submit.x=25&submit.y=9).\n",

The multiband file is easiest to work with becuase it contains all 16 channels on the same 2 km grid. However, some channels have higher resolution. Plotting the full resolution images will take some additional work, not described here. Specifically, you will have to download three separate files, one for each channel, and subsample the red channel 0.5 km grid to a 1 km grid.\n",
